# embryoDog_RNAseq

Pipeline is a script indicating commands and options used to align and annotate RNAseq but path might be broken as I ran commands line by line rather by script. Will update it soon.

Two hisat2 alignment scripts for each sample were writen in perl and I will convert them to python soon as i'm getting familiar with python

All files and data are stored on my google cloud server (35.196.250.12:/data/embryoDog). Email me your public ssh key if need access to them.
