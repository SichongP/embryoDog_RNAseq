# embryoDog_RNAseq
pipeline is a script indicating commands and options used to align and annotate RNAseq but path might be broken as i ran commands line by line rather by script. will update it soon.
two hisat2 alignment scripts for each sample were writen in perl and I will convert them to python soon as i'm getting familiar with python
